            <p>I don't have much skills but I enjoy playing the keyboard sometimes.Ive been learning it since I was around 13 years old but I've not yet perfected the art.
                This has built me up to enjoy music and music making.As of now I'm working on my programming which I hope will be better before I finish my degree.
