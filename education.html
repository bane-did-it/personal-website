            <h2>Academic Achievements</h2>
            <p>My education has been swift.I finished my KCPE in 2021 although we had a long break due to covid pandemic.I was called to Kanjuri High School in Karatina where I had a lot of experiences and met a lot of friends.
                I studied there for four years,got my KCSE certificate and went on to be accepted at Zetech University in Thika where I"m  currently pursuing my degree .I'm in  my second year.I've met a lot of people and still I'm continuing my journey.It's truly a blessing to be in Zetech.
