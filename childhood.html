            <h2>Memorable Childhood Experiences</h2>
            <p>My childhhood experiences majorly revolve around my siblings.We spend a lot of time together.
                I would say mostly they've shaped me and my personality.Ww talk a lot and laugh a lot but at the end of the day we just want to support each other.
                I meet my relatives only once a year but I learn alot from them like how to socially interact and build good realtionships with family.
                I would also say I've shared memorable experiences with them especially during the holidays like christmas where we would light a bonfire at night and surround it.And I love 
                spending time with my cousins too.
